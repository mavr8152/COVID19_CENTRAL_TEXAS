Daily Positive and Fatalities Cases for Travis and Williamson county (TX)

Hi, during the coronavirus lockdown I was curious about daily report for cases in our closest counties in Central Texas. So I made a python script to pull the data from the Texas open source website and send me daily report for two counties: Travis and Williamson.

This project involves Setting up a Gmail Account for Development. To extend the project with the visualization, it was added VBA macro to create png images for the chart on Case count by county. Both scripts (Python and VBA) scheduled on Windows Scheduler. VBS File was created to run VBA on Windows Scheduler.

Updated CountByCounty_template VBA with chart for daily delta for new cases.
